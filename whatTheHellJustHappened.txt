So first in server.js we imported express, mongoose, helmet and cors

Then we created our server

We created our database schema in friendsSchema.js

We then import our schema into our routes file, or friendController.js

Now in our routes file we do something very different, we establish our routes and then 
just add our methods to them.

Seems more efficient and easier to read this way.

We then import our routes into the server.js file.

Now I know what cors stands for but I'm still fuzzy on what it's actually doing.

I need to review cors, helmet, and mongoose.

From what I understand mongoose is connecting our server and its related data to a persistent database called mongodb
We can access that database via http requests with Postman
And we can access it directly with Compass.

This stuff is pretty cool.

Well I'm going to have to go to work now, gonna go clock in.
